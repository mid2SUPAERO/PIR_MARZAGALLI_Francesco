# PIR_MARZAGALLI_Francesco

This repository gives an insight on my PIR, which is dedicated to "Hinged wingtip modelling in NeoCASS based on Airbus AlbatrossONE". The modelling of the hinge device has been proposed in NeoCASS, where both the effects of hinge position and stiffness have been analysed on load distribution for trim and gust conditions.

The folder "NeoCASS files" contains more folders were all the models are stored, in particular the subfolder "comparison" contains the scripts and the results for the compared analysis between all the considered configurations and it it therefore the most interesting one.

NeoCASS website: https://www.neocass.org/

To perform the analysis NeoCass modules are needed, they are free but a request shoul be addressed to neocass@aero.polimi.it to download them. The main folder of this repository (__NeoCASS files__) should be added to Matlab path with the specific command in Matlab home.
