# PIR_MARZAGALLI_Francesco

This repository gives an insight on my PIR, which is dedicated to "Hinged wingtip modelling in NeoCASS based on Airbus AlbatrossONE". The modelling of the hinge device has been proposed in NeoCASS, where both the effects of hinge position and stiffness have been analysed on load distribution for trim and gust conditions.
