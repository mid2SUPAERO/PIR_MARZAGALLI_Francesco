_RunMultipleGust.m_ allows to run the dynamic analysis comparing all the different hinge configuration with the baseline model (no hinge, no wingspan increase). The most important data are then saved in _SolGust.mat_.
All the other file are just some outputs that NeoCASS gives during the running of the script.
