_RunMultipleTrim.m_ allows to run the trim aerolastic analysis comparing all the different hinge configurations with the baseline model (no hinge, no wingspan increase). Two flight conditions have been analysed: Cruise (i=1) and PullUp (i=2) manoeuvre. The most important data are then saved in _SolTrimCruise.mat_ and _SolTrimPullUp.mat_.
All the other file are just text outputs that NeoCASS gives during the running of the script in order to sum up the solution for each considered model.
