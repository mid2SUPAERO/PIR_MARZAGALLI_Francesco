RunMultipleTrim allows to run the trim aerolastic analysis comparing all the different hinge configurations with the baseline model (no hinge, no wingspan increase). Two flight conditions have been analysed: Cruise (i=1) and PullUp (i=2) manoeuvre. The most important data are then saved in SolTrimCruise.mat and SolTrimPullUp.mat.
All the other file are just text outputs that NeoCASS gives during the running of the script in order to sum up the solution for each model considered.
